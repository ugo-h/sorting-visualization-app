<h1>Sorting visualization app</h1>
<p>
    I wanted to know exactly how sorting algorithms perform their task, so, as a visual person, i've attempted to create an app which shows visual representation of their internal workings.
</p>
<h2>The list of shown algorithms includes:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bubble sort</li>
    <li>Insertion sort</li>
    <li>Selection sort</li>
    <li>Merge sort</li>
    <li>Quick sort</li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is fairly easy to add any new algorithm that works with arrays, however I haven't yet tried it with algorithms that use other data structures, like heap or hash.
